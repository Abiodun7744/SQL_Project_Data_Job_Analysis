# Background 
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries ?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn ?

# Tools I Used 
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analytics, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis 
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, i filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
     j.job_id,
     job_title_short,
     job_title,
     job_location,
     job_schedule_type,
     salary_year_avg,
     job_posted_date,
     name AS company_name
FROM 
     job_postings_fact j
LEFT JOIN company_dim c ON j.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE 
     job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
     job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
     salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY 
     salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10 
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000 , indicating significant salary potential in the field.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles. 

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
       j.job_id,
       job_title,
       salary_year_avg,
       name AS company_name
    FROM 
       job_postings_fact j
    LEFT JOIN company_dim c ON j.company_id = c.company_id
    WHERE 
       job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
       job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
       salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    ORDER BY 
       salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10 
)

SELECT 
     t.*,
     skills
FROM top_paying_jobs t
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim sjd ON t.job_id = sjd.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim sd ON sjd.skill_id = sd.skill_id
ORDER BY 
      salary_year_avg DESC 
```
